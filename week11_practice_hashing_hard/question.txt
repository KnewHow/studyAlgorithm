11-散列4 Hashing - Hard Version   (30分)

Given a hash table of size NNN, we can define a hash function . Suppose that the linear probing is used to solve collisions, we can easily obtain the status of the hash table with a given sequence of input numbers.

However, now you are asked to solve the reversed problem: reconstruct the input sequence from the given status of the hash table. Whenever there are multiple choices, the smallest number is always taken.
Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains a positive integer NNN (≤1000\le 1000≤1000), which is the size of the hash table. The next line contains NNN integers, separated by a space. A negative integer represents an empty cell in the hash table. It is guaranteed that all the non-negative integers are distinct in the table.
Output Specification:

For each test case, print a line that contains the input sequence, with the numbers separated by a space. Notice that there must be no extra space at the end of each line.
Sample Input:

11
33 1 13 12 34 38 27 22 32 -1 21

Sample Output:

1 13 12 21 33 34 38 27 22 32
